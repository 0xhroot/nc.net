//new tool nmap ::-
1.Aim: To scan the entire IP range.
Command: nmap <IP range>
Example: nmap 162.16.121.125-135 (here IP range is separated by a dash )
In our example, Nmap will scan the IP addresses from 162.16.121.25/24 to 162.16.121.35/24.

2.Aim: To scan a specific port or entire port range.
Command: nmap -p <numeric value> <IP>
Example: nmap -p 80 192.168.20.128
You can also scan all 65535 ports for your localhost computer by using this command–
nmap -p 1-65535 localhost. 

3.Aim: Host detection
Command: Nmap -sP <target>
Example: Nmap -sP 192.168.2.1/24
In the above example, the “-sP” command will scan the list of devices running on the 192.168.2.1/24 subnet.

4.Aim: To save the result of the Nmap scan to a file or XML.
Command: nmap -oN output.txt example.com (This command will export Nmap scan into a text file)
Command: nmap -oX output.xml example.com (This command will save the output of Nmap scanning in XML)

5.Aim: To scan the fixed number of most popular ports. 
Command: nmap –top-ports <numeric value> <IP address/Domain>
Example: nmap –top-ports 15 196.134.5.67
In our example, we have used the “–top-ports” option to specify that we need to scan the top 15 ports of the IP address 196.134.5.67

6.Aim: To detect open ports.
Command: nmap — open<IP address/domain name> 
Example: nmap — open 198.152.45.33
In the above example, we are using “–open” parameter with IP address 198.152.45.33 so that the Nmap command only shows us the ports with the open state. 

7.Aim: To exclude the host/IP addresses for the scan.
Command: nmap <range of IP address> — exclude<IP address to exclude>
Example: nmap 172.16.121.1/24 — exclude 172.16.121.10
In the above example, we are using the “– exclude”  command-line option to exclude IP address 172.16.121.10 from the scan.
Note – “–exclude command” accepts single IP address, single host, specific ranges, and whole network

8.Aim: Detection of services.
Command: nmap -sV<IP>
Example: nmap -sV 168.121.34.56
In the above example, we are performing a version scan by using the “sV” command and it will give us a list of services with its versions.

//new tool arp-scan ::-
Local scan
In example 1 we are going to find the internal networks running.
sudo arp-scan -l

MSC scan
Now, we are going to see the MAC address of eth0 of the subnet mask
sudo arp-scan -a

Subnet
Scan an IP network with the custom subnet.
sudo arp-scan IP address / port

All in one scan
scanning a custom MAC address with a subnet
sudo arp-scan -I eth0 --srcaddr=macaddress ipaddress/port
